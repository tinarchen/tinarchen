					<h3 class="maintitle">VALUE PROPOSITION</h3>
					<h2 id="projecttitle">Encouraging the Purchase of More Accessories<h2>
					<p>It is ultimately AEO’s goal to sell more and increase revenue. They are a leader in selling jeans, so we thought why can’t they be a leader in selling accessories?<br><br>According to Statistical Portal, revenue in the Accessories market amounts to US$57,909m in 2018. The market is expected to still grow annually by 1.6% (CAGR 2018-2021). Currently, AEO has been a market lead in selling jeans, but perhaps not doing as well in selling accessories and styling, and there is a huge, untapped resource, which is the social shopper. Therefore, our vision is to facilitate those co-shoppers as a styling guide for their friends.</p>
					<h2 id="projecttitle">Customer Aquisition<h2>
					<p>Let loyal AEO customers bring their friends and family into the stores, convert them into loyal customers as well</p>
					<h2 id="projecttitle">Exposure and Effective Styling<h2>
					<p>1. Try new things without feeling like you are being sold to by an associate<br>2. Explore without limitation<br>3. Get inspiration from others like you on the display</p>
					<h2 id="projecttitle">Styling is a Vehicle for Driving Revenue<h2>
					<p>1. More products like accessories sold means more revenue for AEO<br>2. Help Sales Associates meet their sale quota</p>

		<p>We had designers, managers, and associates from AEO come hear what we had created. We got an overwhelming number of positive feedback and appreciation for our idea!

			<p>Our group was constantly switching back and forth several ideas. It was a lot of digging deep into what it actually means to co-create value for AEO and their customers. We went through many iterations and ideas, some that even started as a joke and flourished into our design!</p>

				<li>Fail faster to discard bad ideas earlier and gain better ideas later!</li>
