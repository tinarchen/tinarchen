Most times, you’ll go into the fitting room, and come out and ask for their opinion.<br><br> With AE CO-LAB, located in the fitting room, you will scan your clothes before going into the fitting room- and your outfit will appear on the touchscreen. Your friend is then able to interact with it, choosing accessories that will match the outfit and make their recommendations for you while they wait.</p>

							<li>Fail faster to discard bad ideas earlier and gain better ideas later!</li>
