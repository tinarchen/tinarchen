            <p>We went to the shelter and attended a pet expo to interview adopters, volunteers, employees, and the business owners of shelters. For each, we tailored specific questions to identify the pain points and opportunities. Our observations led us to a few core insights of our key stakeholders:</p>

            <p>We found that people adopt dogs mostly based on how well they connect. <span class="highlight">However, many senior dogs and black dogs are overlooked before getting to the meeting stage.

          <h5 class="sstitle_left between_spacing">First Critque Feedback</h5>
          <p>Feedback on this phase was focused on the scope of our proposed features, causing us to narrow our focus further and shed portions of the site that didn’t explicitly need to be represented or redesigned. Additionally, we cut many of the service provider specific features included in these wireframes to focus on meeting the users’ goals first, with the understanding the better pet-adopter matches would satisfy the underlying needs of the service provider as well.</p>

            <p class="between_spacing">In contrast to prior screens, the results display does a good job of withholding the more technical or medical information associated with a pet until you click into their profile page, only displaying an image, their name, and few select tags taken from the existing biography information. This allows users to connect with dogs visually and get a sense of their personality, both things that potential pet owners do naturally upon meeting a dog for the first time.</p>

            <p>The feedback from this crit is what allowed us to heavily scope down to one feature to redesign for maximum user impact and stakeholder benefit. We needed to translate the personal needs of the user into standard language that service providers at Humane Animal Rescue could use to best match potential adoptees with pets in need.<br><br>We critically reviewed the sum of our research and efforts thus far and refocused on this new goal of humanizing the rigid, cold, and callous process of browsing a database of adoptable pets online. With this and mind, we began on the next phase of the assignment focusing on understanding the user in human terms, posing questions in natural phrases and language, and highlighting the underlying empathy in the pet adoption process.</p>

      <p>Based on all discussions we had and feedback we got, our objective was scoped down to helping first time adopters adopt what are generally less adopted, such as senior or black dogs.

We went from wanting to include numerous features in our website to just focusing on our filter function.<br><br><span class="highlight">The problem space we focused on in the end was creating a filter function that helps first time adopters find their ideal dog while promoting the dogs that are less likely to be adopted in shelters.</span></p>

    <h5 class="sstitle">Main Filter Flow</h5>
    <p class="narrow">After our first user testing, we realized we needed to create more feedback in terms of typography, color, and spacing. We needed to occupy more screen space for the filter, and allowing the user to go in-and-out of the filter, rather that scrolling all the way back up. We also wanted to create a more “fun” aspect to filtering by using a paw, small micro-interaction that user might find rewarding.<br><Br>We knew we did not want to let the filter hinder the results of other potential dogs so we used a toggle switch to allow the user to afford the on/off states of the filter.</p>

            <p>Overall, our design was very well appreciated by audience. Steffi, who was from Humane Animal Rescue, commented that we had a very good focus with the goal to “decrease length of stay, as a shelter person, reducing length of stay is the holy grail. I got a chuckle out of the scenario they came up with, the empty-nester from Shadyside, that was a nice touch”.</p>

    <h8 class="maintitle">NEXT STEPS</h8>
    <h2 id="projecttitle">My Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>It was easy to rush into designing what we wanted to achieve, which was a system that could help less adoptable dogs get adopted. However, I quickly learned that it is not that easy and that there are many design considerations that I did not even think of.
    <ul>
      <li>A pivotal moment in this project was when I learned that too much information gathering would hinder the user from continuing with the filter, creating a barrier to entry.</li>
      <li>Learning to put the more humanized filter first, before all the general information, made me realize how important progressive disclosure is in order to develop trust in the design.</li>
      <li>It was especially hard to think of design in the light of three different stakeholders. It really pushed me to think beyond just the user.</li>
      <li>This was my favorite project this semester, not just because our topic was on pet adoption, but because there was so much more to think and ponder about.</li>
