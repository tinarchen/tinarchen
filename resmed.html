      <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
      <h1>AMELIO</h1>
      <p>Amelio is a native mobile application that provides patients with support communities while empowering better patient and care giver experiences through capturing real emotional data.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="work">
      <h1>How can we retain value for Resmed through patient data?</h1>
      <p>50% of home care patients are not compliant to their therapy because of poor provider training and compliance monitoring. We kickstarted the discovery process by running a 2-day research sprint. The goal was to synthesize as much information about ResMed as we could manage.<br><br>Through background research, we found that individuals who suffer from sleep apnea are at risk to develop more severe conditions, such as high blood pressure, heart failure, and depression. It is essential for people with sleep apnea to seek treatment right away. But patients don’t comply, and Resmed can’t understand why.</p>

        <h2>PRODUCT</h2>
        <h1>Micro Interactions</h1>
        <h3>Guerrilla Research</h3>
        <p>Amelio helps the people who use ResMed devices feel like they have a community and that they’re being heard. Through writing about their experiences, both good and bad, on the forum platform, customers can support one another. For the respiratory therapist, they can use the data garnered from the forum to help improve the lives of their patients. ResMed can leverage that real emotional data to generate stronger insights to produce better customer experiences- and better customer experiences translate to better sales and higher quality products and services.</p>

            <h1>Respiratory Therapists</h1>
            <p>Respiratory therapists are primarily in charge of installing devices for patients and answering any questions the patient might have on usage.  Thus, we created interactions that helped therapists get a holistic sense of the products and patients they are caring for.</p>

            <p>The micro-interactions for the patient were centered around the chat forum. We wanted to create a space that was interactive, inviting and enjoyable for the user.  We also wanted to help patients visualize the variety of conversations in this area to reduce the sense of isolation that they sometimes feel.</p>

      <h2>DISCOVERY & IDEATION</h2>
      <h1>Connecting human needs to company goals</h1>
      <p>With our understanding of the various stakeholders within the ResMed system, we clustered like-entities to organize our research, as well as to pry out some initial insights. From there we did several exercises to broaden our thinking and helped us explore more holistic solutions.</p>

        <h1>Establishing value between domains</h1>
        <p>Now that we established a basic stakeholder flow, it seemed logical that we also map out value between the domains represented by the delivery and usage of ResMed products.<br><br>Being able to highlight services and agreements also showed where the flow of value was lacking. For instance, there currently exists a weak co-creation value link between patients and the business side, through the basic service provided by RTs. One question we asked is:</p>
        <h4>How could patients retain a stronger value by transferring their data to ResMed?</h4>

        <h1>Bubble Chat Forum</h1>
        <p>We iterated on a variety of concepts for micro-interactions in order to discover the appropriate emotions, desirability, and transitions that we wanted to convey.<br><br>A fun micro-interaction we explored on was the manner in which people would click into, explore, and comment on various discussions in the forum platform. Although we ultimately did not end up using this iteration, it laid the basis for the next level of micro-interactions that we designed.

      <p>Amelio connect others through the forum platform, gathering data on human feelings and emotions.

      <h2>Learnings</h2>
      <h1>My Final Thoughts</h1>
      <p>Through our process, we were able to dive into a topic none of us were familiar with. We explored the respiratory devices industry and how micro-interactions can enhance user value in the overall application.<br><br>Ultimately, I learned to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Design a service that involved understanding the gaps in the value flow between stakeholders. We needed to help patients feel like they are being treated and heard, while helping the company provide the best possible products.</li>
        <li>Take ownership of the entire design process, with less hand-holding. We generate our own design plan and process, and carried it out with as much detail as possible.</li>
        <li>Bring some magic to the table by using subtle, but delightful micro-interactions that goes a long way!</li>
      </ul>
