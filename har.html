      <p>Humane Animal Rescue have rich histories of helping animals in our community. They aim to bring greater efficiency in animal care processes, staff training, and cutting-edge practices to one cohesive organization.</p>

      <h1>Humanized Pet Filtering</h1>
      <p>We designed a filtering system that tailors the results to the user’s favorite qualities about dogs. It also enables users to discover dog breeds that they might not have had in mind in the first place.</p>

          <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
          <h1>Discovering the Needs of Our Stakeholders</h1>
          <h3>Guerrilla Research</h3>
          <p>We went to the shelter and attended a pet expo to interview adopters, volunteers, employees, and the business owners of shelters. For each, we tailored specific questions to identify the pain points and opportunities. Our observations led us to a few core insights of our key stakeholders:</p>

          <h2>PROBLEM</h2>
          <h1>Adoption Barriers</h1>
          <p>We found that people adopt dogs mostly based on how well they connect. <span class="highlight">However, many senior dogs and black dogs are overlooked before getting to the meeting stage. This is the main service provider problem we wanted to focus on.</span> We scoped down from the entire process that a dog goes through in the shelter, which included getting noticed on social media and potentially being given up again after adoption.</p>

      <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
      <h1>Customer Journey Mapping</h1>
      <p>Keeping the stakeholder triangle in mind, we synthesized our research into insights, pain points, and opportunities.</p>
      <h3>Adopter's Journey Map</h3>
      <p>During our first critique, we were told that this was too broad and to focus of one aspect so we decided to focus of the period of time before adopting a dog.</p> 
      <img class="img-responsive star" src="assets/journeymap_customer.png" width="100%" height="auto">  
      <br><br>
      <h3>Service Providers's Journey Map</h3>
      <p>By analyzing the time before a dog was adopted, we learned that the only interaction between customer and service provider was the pre-adoption and adoption phases.</p>

      <br><br>
      <h3>Creating Useful Personas</h3>
      <p>Creating the right persona influenced our direction for design. We knew it was critical to base our persona on our research with real people and not based on assumptions. The key goal for Jhené was to focus on getting her a dog that matches her existing dog.</p>

      <h1>People Care About Personality</h1>
      <p>After analyzing the feedback we got from speed dating we were able to gain several insights:</p>
      <p id="serif">1. People have preferences on the characteristics of dogs.<br>2. People are not as interested in exposure to detailed information on dogs initially.<br>3. They want a smooth adoption process.<br>4. They want to learn more about the qualities of the dogs.</p>

          <h1>Our Pitch Outcomes</h1>
          <p>Overall, our design was very well appreciated by our audience. Steffi, who was from Humane Animal Rescue, commented that we had a very good focus with the goal to “decrease length of stay, as a shelter person, reducing length of stay is the holy grail. I got a chuckle out of the scenario they came up with, the empty-nester from Shadyside, that was a nice touch”.</p>

      <h2>NEXT STEPS</h2>
      <h1>My Final Thoughts</h1>
      <p>It was easy to rush into designing what we wanted to achieve, which was a system that could help less adoptable dogs get adopted. However, I quickly learned that it is not that easy and that there are many design considerations that I did not even think of.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A pivotal moment in this project was when I learned that too much information gathering would hinder the user from continuing with the filter, creating a barrier to entry.</li>
        <li>Learning to put the more humanized filter first, before all the general information, made me realize how important progressive disclosure is in order to develop trust in the design.</li>
        <li>It was especially hard to think of design in the light of three different stakeholders. It really pushed me to think beyond just the user.</li>
        <li>This was my favorite project this semester, not just because our topic was on pet adoption, but because there was so much more to think and ponder about.</li>
      </ul>
